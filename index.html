                <b>In examining the social and geographical parameters</b>, data has supported a detailed analysis of the trends in the city's prostitution occurrences. We believe internet access has had an influece on the recordings. The release of the iPhone 3G in 2008 - one of the first smartphones, offering access to platforms, which likely influenced the decline in recorded prostitution incidents in San Francisco starting that year (2008), as seen in Graph 1. This suggests a shift from street-based activities to online platforms.

            In 2017, a new hotspot appeared in downtown San Francisco at Onion Square. This area, known for its numerous hotels and bars, highlights the relation between online platforms and geographical influences on the city's social dynamics. The concentration of nightlife, hotels, and venues likely complements the digital shift which is illustrating the factors contributing to urban trends.

        <div class="cont2"> <b>A key location in 
            San Francisco</b>, underwent significant changes around 2009. 
            Observations from Google Maps revealed that the area was under construction at the time,
            transforming from an isolated, industrial zone into a family-friendly 
            residential neighborhood with a park and coffee shops.
            This urban change likely contributed to the reduction in recorded incidents.
             In 2017 the same spot only had 1 incident,
              where in 2009 it had 164. 
              This location can be found on the below map at the ‘In Chan Kaajal Park’ on 17th street.
